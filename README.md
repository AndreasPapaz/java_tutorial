For the rest of the year I will be dedicating my time to learn Java.

## Why Learn Java???

for me, i want a language that i can run everywhere. Java has been in the most popular language
group according to `https://octoverse.github.com`

My two main languages are `Python` & `JavaScript` with some dashes of `swift` & `go`. While Python and JavaScript
are dynamically typed and interpreted, I believe learning a widely used compiled & statically typed language will
provide me a solid understanding of `OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMING`

p.s.

I like to start small. `Hello World!` is still important even after you are well versed in programming.
Dont skip the small details, You will eventually skip enough to the point you will have to start over.
